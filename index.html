                    <p class="text-faded">The dictionary defines a yuppie as a well-paid young middle-class professional who works in a city job and has a luxurious lifestyle.  If this defines you, and you have a strong desire to learn Capoeira, then Yuppie Capoeira is designed for you.</a>
		    <p class="text-faded">That’s because Yuppie Capoeira is the brainchild of Professor Zumbi, a graduate of the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and a yuppie that had a strong passion for Capoeira. After receiving his MBA from the renowned Ivy League School, Zumbi became increasingly committed to sharing his passion with likeminded professionals. Professor Zumbi started his Capoeira voyage while studying the management of computer information systems at the University of California at Berkeley. While there he studied under Mestre Caverinha, Contra Mestre Xango and Contra Mestre Berinjela, Later he became a student of Mestre Chicote, and occasionally had the privilege of taking workshops from the grand master Mestre Suassuna and a few other great masters. In 2015, the grand master Mestre Acordeon presented him with his “professor” cord at Mestre Chicote’s Pass a Frente Formatura in Paris.</p>

		    <p class="text-muted">The mastery of Capoeira takes years and every Capoeira practitioner must trod a unique path to unleash their particular abilities artfully in a game of Capoeira. To get there you’ll need a coach. Professor Zumbi is an accredited Capoeira teacher with many years of teaching experience in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Over the years, and because of teaching Capoeira to various societies and different cultures, Professor Zumbi has developed a specific training regimen to help you get fluent in the art and practice of Capoeira.</p>
		    <p class="text-muted">The course of study at Yuppie Capoeira is meant to integrate Capoeira into your existing lifestyle. For that reason, instruction will be provided in the facilities that you normally use for your daily workouts. Professor Zumbi will act like a personal trainer that not only helps you to attain your Capoeira aspirations, but also coach you through reaching your general health and fitness goals.</p>
		    <p class="text-muted">Practice Capoeira one-on-one with Professor Zumbi and progress gradually through five modules: Offence, Defence, Strength, Balance, and Music. For beginners, Zumbi recommends training one module for at least one hour each business day and using the weekends to recover and rest the body. This is ideal and beginners should maintain this schedule for the first two months of Capoeira lessons.</p>
